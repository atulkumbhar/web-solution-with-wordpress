# Web Solution With WordPress
You are progressing in practicing to implement web solutions using different technologies. As a DevOps engineer you will most probably encounter [PHP](https://www.php.net/)-based solutions since, even in 2021, it is the dominant web programming language used by more websites than any other programming language.

In this project you will be tasked to prepare storage infrastructure on two Linux servers and implement a basic web solution using WordPress. [WordPress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress) is a free and open-source content management system written in PHP and paired with MySQL or MariaDB as its backend Relational Database Management System (RDBMS).

- Install WordPress and connect it to a remote MySQL database server. This part of the project will solidify your skills of deploying Web and DB tiers of Web solution.

As a DevOps engineer, your deep understanding of core components of web solutions and ability to troubleshoot them will play essential role in your further progress and development.

Generally, web, or mobile solutions are implemented based on what is called the **Three-tier Architecture**.

**Three-tier Architecture** is a client-server software architecture pattern that comprise of 3 separate layers.
